  features:
  - title: Dimensional data
    icon: flask
    text: Prometheus implements a highly dimensional data model. Time series are identified by a metric name and a set of key-value pairs.
  - title: Powerful queries
    icon: search
    text: A flexible query language allows slicing and dicing of collected time series data in order to generate ad-hoc graphs, tables, and alerts.
  - title: Great visualization
    icon: chart-line
    fa: true
    text: |
      Prometheus has multiple modes for visualizing data: a built-in expression browser, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) integration, and a console template language.
  - title: Efficient storage
    icon: database
    text: Prometheus stores time series in memory and on local disk in an efficient custom format. Scaling is achieved by functional sharding and federation.
  - title: Simple operation
    icon: cogs
    text: Each server is independent for reliability, relying only on local storage. Written in Go, all binaries are statically linked and easy to deploy.
  - title: Precise alerting
    icon: exclamation-triangle
    text: Alerts are defined based on Prometheus's flexible query language and maintain dimenstional information. An Alertmanager handles notifications and silencing.
  - title: Many client libraries
    icon: code
    fa: true
    text: Client libraries allow for easy instrumentation of services. Over ten languages are supported already and custom libraries are easy to implement.
  - title: Many integrations
    icon: cloud-upload-alt

      Existing exporters allow for bridging of third-party data into Prometheus. Examples: system statistics, as well as Docker, HAProxy, StatsD, and JMX metrics.
